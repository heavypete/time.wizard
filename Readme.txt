Initial thought - one extremely long page with epic amounts
of "dead" space between settings, so user uses "go to" links to
jump to a certain section.
+simulates time - allows user to bypass links if they are willing
to do the tedious scrolling.
- probably too much to load, especially if I want to weigh it
down with all the dead space/text/imagery I'm imagining.

Makes more sense to have each setting/destination to be a different
html page.
